# Wine-Game-Compatibilities
Keeping track of how specific games run under specific Wine prefixes, what tweaks are needed, and if it works or not.

There's a separate games-list.md that keeps track of all of the compatibilities, read that instead. I'm incompetent and don't exactly have a blog to do this on, so Github is my lazy way out.
